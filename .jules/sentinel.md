## 2025-03-09 - [Missing Security Headers and Input Length Validation]
**Vulnerability:** [The application lacked basic security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options) and the `/api/chat` endpoint did not enforce any length limits on the `message` input, opening it to DoS attacks.]
**Learning:** [These basic protections were likely missed during initial development when the focus was on core functionality and prototyping.]
**Prevention:** [Implement a robust baseline of security headers (like Helmet or manual injection) and enforce input size bounds directly at API boundaries.]
